Reguirements - pygame, neat-python

Birds learn to play the game Flappy Bird. 

Birds decide themselves whether to jump and are awarded fitness points from surviving and passing pipes. When all birds have collided, a new generation of birds is generated based on the previous generation. 

The game is built with PyGame and NEAT-Python is implemented.

There is comments in the code to help to understand it.
